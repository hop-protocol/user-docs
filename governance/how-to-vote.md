# How to Vote

To participate in Hop governance with your HOP tokens you need to first delegate your voting power to yourself. \
\
This requires an on-chain transaction and costs some gas. If you prefer you can also delegate your voting power to one of the [existing delegates](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/hop/delegates). \
\
Once you have delegated you will be able to vote for the **next** governance vote. \
\
Both actions can be done here: [https://www.tally.xyz/gov/hop](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/hop) \
\
Currently you need to hold the tokens on Ethereum as Hop uses the same governance contracts as most DAO's like Uniswap, ENS, Compound etc. \
\
However, multichain governance is an active area of research.
