# Protocol Fees & Public Good Funding

Per [HIP-16](https://forum.hop.exchange/t/rfc-protocol-fees-and-a-commitment-to-public-goods-funding/566), the Hop DAO has decided to introduce a protocol fee along with the introduction of the V2 Core Messenger. The fee switch will be enabled separately on every module built on the Core Messenger (messaging, token bridge, nft bridge, etc.) to help cover general costs in the DAO. \
\
HIP-16 also recognizes the importance of public goods and commits to direct a share of the fees collected to the funding of public goods. This aligns Hop closely with the Ethereum community and further enshrines it as public infrastrucutre.\
\
Details of this initiative are still being fleshed out and we invite anyone to participate in this discussion.&#x20;
