# Becoming a Delegate

Once you have delegated tokens to yourself or have received delegations from other people you are **automatically** a Hop delegate technically speaking.\


It is best practice to follow these steps and write a short application in the Hop governance forum [delegate post](https://forum.hop.exchange/t/apply-as-a-hop-dao-delegate/) and complete your Delegate profile (bio, profile picutre etc.) on Tally.

## Delegate Incentivization Trial

There is currently a delegate incentivization trial happening, that aims to attract and retain both entities and individuals who actively participate in governance on behalf of HOP token-holders.\
\
The Program lasts for 6 months and can be renewed by the DAO.

**Minimum Participation Requirement**: To remain eligible for delegate incentives, a delegate must maintain at least a 90% participation rate. Participation is measured as voting in any “temperature check” or on-chain governance vote.

**Minimum Communication Requirement**: To remain eligible for delegate incentives, a delegate must maintain at least a 90% communication rate. Participation is measured as providing for any “temperature check” or on-chain governance vote a summary, voting position, and justification for that position. A missed vote will still require communication to avoid a lower communication rate.

**Measurement Period**: Both minimum requirements will be measured on a 6-month basis, which is also the intended length of this trial. If this program is renewed, participation and communication requirements will continue to be measured on a rolling 6-month (182-day) basis.

**Minimum Delegation Threshold**: To remain eligible for delegate incentives, a delegate must maintain at least 90,000 HOP voting weight.
