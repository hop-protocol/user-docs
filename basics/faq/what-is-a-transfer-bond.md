# What is a "Transfer bond"?

A transfer bond is the bonding of a transfer root which distributes the transfer root from layer-1 to layer-2 destination rollup chains. Only the bonder role can do this and it requires a positive credit balance. Someone may challenge this transfer root if they believe it contains invalid transfers.
