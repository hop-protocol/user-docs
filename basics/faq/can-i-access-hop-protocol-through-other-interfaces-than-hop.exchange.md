# Can I access Hop Protocol through other interfaces than Hop.Exchange?

The Hop **protocol** is trustless and decentralized because it lives entirely on-chain. Anyone running an Ethereum node can **interact with the contracts directly** which will perform as programmed for as long as Ethereum exists.&#x20;

Users can also access the Hop Protocol for bridging assets through other web interfaces such as bridge aggregators aggregators, or other DAPPs that have integrated Hop natively in their smart contracts.\
