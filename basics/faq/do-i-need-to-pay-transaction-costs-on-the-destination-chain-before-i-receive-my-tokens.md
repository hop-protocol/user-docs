# Do I need to pay transaction costs on the destination chain before I receive my tokens?

No you **don't need to complete any action** on the destination chain to receive the transferred tokens. They are sent directly into your wallet in one transaction.\
\
However, you do need some funds in your wallet to pay for **future transactions** you intend to do on the Layer-2 network.\
\
For example, if you send $USDC to Arbitrum and you plan to sell that $USDC on Uniswap Arbitrum for $AAVE, you will need $ETH to pay for the Arbitrum network costs. On Optimism network costs are also charged in $ETH.\
\
On xDAI you will need $xDAI to pay for gas costs and on Polygon you need $MATIC.
