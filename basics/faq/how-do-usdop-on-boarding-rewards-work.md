# How do $OP on-boarding rewards work?

The Hop DAO received 1m $OP tokens as part of the initial Optimism airdrops to projects building early on Optimism.\
\
These funds have been allocated to an on-boarding scheme where users receive 80% of the bridge fees paid back to them in $OP tokens almost completely removing the friction to bridge into Optimism and making Hop the cheapest route to bridge into Optimism.\
\
The amount is based on a fixed percentage of the _source transaction fee_ (based on gas cost on Ethereum) + _Bonder fee_ + _AMM fee_. Moreover, it's capped at 20 $OP per transfer.\

\
The rewards can be collected in the "rewards" section of the Hop home page. \
\
"Claimable" rewards are all [$OP](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24OP\&src=cashtag_click) that you can claim immediately.

\
"Pending" rewards are all [$OP](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24OP\&src=cashtag_click) that you’ll be able to claim once the merkle root is published for the week.\
\
There’s no rush to claim your “claimable” rewards. Rewards continue to add up as you do new transfers on Hop so it’s completely up to you when you want to claim. \
