# My funds are stuck on a Layer-2 network because I can't pay the gas needed for transactions

If this happened to you do not despair, it's a common problem users face after bridging funds to a new network.\
\
On every network you need to own the native gas token to pay for transaction fees. On Optimistic rollups like Arbitrum and Optimism the gas token is $ETH and on sidechains like Polygon and Gnosis chain the gas token is $MATIC and $xDAI respectively.\
\
Below you will find some centralized exchanges (CEX) and fiat on-ramps to quickly get your hands on some of the needed cryptocurrencies on each network without paying high fees.
