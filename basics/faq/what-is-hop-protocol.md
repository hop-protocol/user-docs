# What is Hop Protocol?

Hop is a scalable rollup-to-rollup general token bridge. It allows users to send tokens from one rollup or sidechain to another almost immediately without having to wait for the networks challenge period.\
\
It works by involving market makers (referred to as Bonder) who front the liquidity at the destination chain in exchange for a small fee.\
\
This credit is extended by the Bonder in form of hTokens which are then swapped for their native token counterpart in an AMM.

&#x20;

The end result allows users to seamlessly transfer tokens from one network to the next.\
