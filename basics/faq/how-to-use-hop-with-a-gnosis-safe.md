# How to use Hop with a Gnosis Safe?

If you have funds in a Gnosis Safe smart contract wallet and want to use Hop to bridge funds between networks you can do so via the Gnosis Safe Mobile app in combination with Wallet Connect or through the Gnosis Safe Web App on Desktop.\
\
This guide will show you how to do it via the Gnosis Safe Web App. \
\
&#xNAN;_**Important: If you send to your own Gnosis Safe App on another network verify the address!**_\
\
**1) Go to "Apps" and search for Hop**\
You can also bookmark the Hop app if you want it to appear on the App homescreen in the future.

\
**2) Connect Wallet, Choose Destination Network and Amount to Send**\
Once the Hop app opens within Gnosis Safe you'll see that the Connected Wallet will be your Gnosis Safe Address. You can see that by verifying that the address in the top right of the Hop app corresponds with your Safe address.\

\


**3) Set Recipient**\
Enter the address that you want to send funds to. If you want to send to your Gnosis Safe App on another chain, **it's super important that you enter the right address.** Don't assume that your Gnosis Safe App on the other chain will be the same than the chain you're sending from!\
\
**In 99.9% of the cases the address will be different.**\

\
**4) Confirm Transaction**\
Hit on "send" in the Hop UI and then "Submit" when the Gnosis Safe transaction modal pops up. If it requires multiple signatures your wallet (Metamask, Rainbow etc.) will prompt you for a signature.\
\
If you're in a position to execute the transaction because you're the last signer, your wallet will prompt you for an execution. You will need gas in the wallet you're executing from (Metamask, Rainbow etc.) to pay for the transaction fees.
