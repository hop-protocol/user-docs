# How does a rogue chain affect my LP position on another chain?

A rogue chain/L2 can only negatively affect the Liquidity Providers on that specific chain. If for instance, blockchain validators on one chain would collude and create tokens out of thin air, they could cause price movements and slip pools on that chain only.

The Hop LPs on other L2s cannot be affected by this because Hopâ€™s accounting system makes sure that Hop tokens maliciously minted on one chain can not simply be exchanged for Hop tokens on another L2.\

The bonder can be affected negatively if they bond a transfer that was created maliciously on the rogue chain, but the LPs will not be affected.
